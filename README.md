# React Component Integration Guide

This project provides a React component that can be integrated into your existing React application. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but you can use it in any React environment.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Development

Run the app locally in development mode:

`npm start`

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

Hot reloading is enabled, so changes will appear immediately.

### Production Build

Create an optimized build for deployment:

```
npm run build
```

This generates a build folder with minified, production-ready assets. You can serve these files with any static hosting provider or integrate them into your existing deployment process.

## Future Configurability

Currently, the components (e.g., `HeroSection`, `MembershipSection`, `WaitingListSection`, `FaqSection`) use hardcoded content and images. In the next stage of development, these components could be refactored to accept **props** for all textual content, images, and call-to-action links. This would allow:

- Easy customization of headlines, subheadlines, descriptions, and button text.
- Dynamic replacement of images for desktop and mobile.
- Reuse of components in different contexts without duplicating code.

This approach would make the components fully configurable and easier to maintain as content or design changes.
